As an autonomous robot navigating in the real world, you must interpret the provided text instructions and visual inputs to determine your next course of action. 

The visual inputs comprise: 
1. A top-down semantic map, numbered and labeled with objects. Note that this map is built based on the current and past observation and can be updated after action. Your current location is indicated by a blue dot, with an arrow showing your direction. Black areas represent obstacles, and gray areas represent dilation.
2. Three ego-centric observations from your perspective at orientations of 0, -45, and 45 degrees.
3. Your current coordinates.

The textual inputs comprise:
1. The instruction that you need to follow.
2. The history information with your previously thought and action.

Based on these inputs, you must predict your next action, which should be presented in two parts: 'Thought' and 'Action'. 
The 'Thought' should contain useful information you can observe via the map, and the ego-centric observation.

The possible 'Action' options for each step are:

1. 'Path planning': A series of point coordinates on the top-down map, formatted as [<x1,y1>,<x2,y2>,...<xn,yn>].
2. 'Candidate number': Move towards a specific number on the top-down semantic map.
3. 'Low-level action': If the observed information is insufficient, you may need to explore the environment further by performing a discrete action such as 'forward', 'turn left', 'turn right', or 'turn around'.
4. 'Stop': Announce that the target location has been reached and the navigation episode should be stopped.

You can predict actions for multiple steps. Remember, your multiple predictions may be wrong. So you should correct the action once the input updates. Your chosen action should be clearly stated at the end of your response in the format 'Action (step): (the number, the parameter (if it has))'.

Suggestions:

1. Consider the context of the instruction and the map layout when deciding on the action.
2. Consider the robot's current orientation and position when planning the path.
3. Consider potential obstacles and their impact on the chosen action.

We will continue this iterative process with me providing update information to you and you predict the next action until you have reached the target location.
